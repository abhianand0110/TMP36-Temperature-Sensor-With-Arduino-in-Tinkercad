# TMP36-Temperature-Sensor-With-Arduino-in-Tinkercad

> In this project, you will turn the Arduino into a thermometer! Use a temperature sensor to measure your skin temperature, and register the output with three LEDs. Even though the Arduino is a digital tool, it can interpret signals from an analog input, like the TMP36 temperature sensor, using the built in Analog-to-Digital (ADC) converter, accessed through the analog pins A0-A5
